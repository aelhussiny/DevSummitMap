Sonar: Natural language interfaces to GIS

Demo Theater 3 - Oasis 1 - Andrew Turner
DESCRIPTION
Web GIS has become a ubiquitous and powerful platform for data sharing and
information access. Over the past decades, technology has shifted from
desktops, to servers, to web, then mobile, and now is time for another paradigm
shift: voice. Geographic information can now be integrated with emerging
devices for voice and chat interfaces that provide quick and easy access by
anyone, anywhere. Additionally, 70% of U.S. adults use social media regularly
and 77% own a smartphone. So, we need to consider new experiences for
accessing our GIS.
In this demo theater, we'll show how you can start building your own chatbots
and voice interfaces that integrate directly with ArcGIS. Using Sonar, an opensource
library developed by Esri, you can explore how to make your information
accessible through these new, ubiquitous technologies.
